# heater-canvas
OOP Fall 21 Quarter One Project - Creates a Canvas that holds a Fahrenheit-based thermostat that performs two different methods to make the temperature hotter or colder.

The Heater class creates a Canvas that holds a heater. The method makeColder makes the temperature decrease and changes the color of the main temperature gauge in the Canvas. The method makeWarmer makes the temperature decrease and changes the color of the main temperature gauge in the Canvas. If the temperature goes above 100 degrees Fahrenheit or below 0 degrees Fahrenheit, the Canvas displays an error. 

The Start class creates a Heater object.
